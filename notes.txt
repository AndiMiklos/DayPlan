For storing tasks:
One table which contains task details, periodicity and everything (maybe called taskDetails)
One table which contains tasks marked as completed

Example:
Current date 15.08.2021
Fetch 01.08.2021 -> 31.08.2021
from 01.08.2021 -> 15.08.2021 fetching and displaying history tasks
from 15.08.2021 -> 31.08.2021 getting the task info and in frontend display the following occurances of the task

??? maybe compute task occurances in the past to, and display them only when there is not an entry into task history for that date

if task is marked as completed, insert into task history
